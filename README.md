# MLfromScratch

Welcome to **MLfromScratch**, the repository where I build machine learning algorithms from the ground up. This repository is intended to demonstrate how foundational ML algorithms can be implemented without the use of high-level ML libraries.

## Motivation

The purpose of this repository is educational. By coding these algorithms from scratch, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind each algorithm and the principles of machine learning.

## Algorithms

Here is a list of algorithms that I plan to implement:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis

## Structure

Each algorithm has its own directory containing:

- A README explaining the algorithm's theory
- A `.py` file with the algorithm's implementation
- A Jupyter notebook with usage examples

## Contributing

Interested in contributing? Great! You can contribute in several ways:

- Suggesting new algorithms to implement
- Improving existing implementations
- Adding more examples or improving documentation
